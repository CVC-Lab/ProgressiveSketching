This is a quick summary of the associated code included in this supplementary material.
There are 3 examples included in the experiment: 
1. Cardiac MRI
2. NARR Air Temperature
3. Hyperspectral Image

Here are the basic information of the files included:
1. datasets are in the folder "data." NARR air temperature counldn't be included due to file size limitation. It can be downloaded from \href{https://downloads.psl.noaa.gov//Datasets/NARR/pressure/air.202010.nc}
2. "PerformanceComparison" folder contains performance comparisons (Figures 1, 3, 5). "functions.py" contains every full-scan algorithms, R-SCT, P-SCT. Jupyter notebooks show how the experiments are conducted for each dataset.
3. "LearningCurve" folder contains the learning curve comparions (Figures 2, 4, 6). Three Python scripts contain the algorithms for the experiment. "ResultsSummary_AISTATS" shows how the Figures are drawn.
